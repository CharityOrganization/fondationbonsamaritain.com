Currently, there are two administrative roles available in enterprise accounts: enterprise owners, who can access and manage all settings across the account, and billing managers, who can access and manage only the enterprise account's billing settings. Enterprise owners can also see all of the members and outside collaborators for every organization owned by the enterprise account.
