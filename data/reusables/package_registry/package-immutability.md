To prevent confusion and build problems, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} permanently reserves a package's name and version number. Even if an entire package is deleted, you cannot reuse the deleted package name in any repository owned by the same account.

To revise or replace a package version, we recommend you publish a new version of your package.
