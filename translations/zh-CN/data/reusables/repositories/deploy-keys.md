You can launch projects from a {% data variables.product.product_name %} repository to your server by using a deploy key, which is an SSH key that grants access to a single repository. {% data variables.product.product_name %} attaches the public part of the key directly to your repository instead of a personal user account, and the private part of the key remains on your server. 更多信息请参阅“[交付部署](/v3/guides/delivering-deployments/)”。
