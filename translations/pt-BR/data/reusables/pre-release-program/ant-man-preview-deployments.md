**Note:** The `transient_environment` and `production_environment` parameters are currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the API may change without advance notice. Veja o post do [blogue](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-04-06-deployment-and-deployment-status-enhancements) para obter informações completas.

To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
