**Note:** The Commit Search API is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the APIs may change without advance notice. Veja o post do [blogue](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-01-05-commit-search-api/) para obter informações completas.

To access the API you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
