# Redirects

There are a number of ways to configure redirects in the site.

## Local redirects

Sometimes we change the name of an article but want its old URL to redirect to its new URL. For these types of redirects, we use `redirect_from` frontmatter. See [/content#redirect_from](/content#redirect_from) for details.

## External redirects

Sometimes the canonical home of some content moves outside the help site. For these types of redirects, we add entries to [/lib/external-redirects.json](/lib/external-redirects.json).

## Custom redirects

We also have custom routing code that dynamically handles things like moved [hidden pages](/content#hidden-pages) or deprecated products like GitHub Desktop Classic. This code lives in [/middleware/redirects.js](/middleware/redirects.js).

## Autogenerated redirects

The site automatically generates a number of redirects under the hood:

| Redirect from | Redirect to | Example
| -- | -- | -- |
| Path without a language prefix | Path with an English prefix | `https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git` to `https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git`
| Redirect without a language code | Path with an English prefix | `https://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git` to `https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git/`
| Enterprise path without a version | Path with the latest version | `https://help.github.com/enterprise` to `https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16`
| Enterprise path that includes `/guides/` | Path without `/guides/` | `https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation` to `https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/admin/installation`
| Desktop path that includes `/guides/` | Path without `/guides/` | `https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects` to `https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects`

See [Debugging](contribution/debugging.md) for info on viewing the redirects for any page.
